            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or prabhu.[28] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was very important part of the education.[29] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -PÃ¡li language.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">With the advent of Islam in India the traditional methods of education increasingly came under Islamic influence.[32] Pre-Mughal rulers such as Qutb-ud-din Aybak and other Muslim rulers initiated institutions which imparted religious knowledge.[32] Scholars such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Moinuddin Chishti became prominent educators and established Islamic monasteries.[32] Students from Bukhara and Afghanistan visited India to study humanities and science.[32] Islamic institution of education in India included traditional madrassas and maktabs which taught grammar, philosophy, mathematics, and law influenced by the Greek traditions inherited by Persia.
